# MindFriend
The application acts as a digital confidant. Unlike a standard chatbot, it is programmed with a specific "MindfulMate" persona—characterized by warmth, active listening, and a non-judgmental tone. Its primary goal is to help users bridge the gap between their daily experiences and their emotional well-being.
